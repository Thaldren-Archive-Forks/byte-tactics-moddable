# Reference build and scenarios

`uv run tools/reference.py HEAD` builds `build/reference/HEAD/TotalA.exe`: the
current commit, with the harness in `src/harness/harness.cpp`. The game functions
the harness changes are listed in `changed.txt`.

## Running a scenario

The exe takes a scenario file with `-testmode`. It starts a skirmish from the
file without menus or input, plays `ticks` game ticks, and exits with status 0.
A bad scenario or a failed check exits with status 2 and a message on stderr
that names the line.

```sh
build/reference/HEAD/TotalA.exe -testmode reference/scenarios/skirmish2.txt
WINEARCH=win64 uv run tools/playtest.py --exe build/reference/HEAD/TotalA.exe \
  --testmode reference/scenarios/skirmish2.txt     # under Wine, headless
```

The FPU check ignores the infinity-control bit, which no x87 since the 80387
uses, so both `0x9001F` and Wine's `0xD001F` pass.

## Scenario format

One `key value` per line. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
Numbers are decimal, `0x` hex or `0` octal. Unknown keys and values that do not
parse are errors. A later line for the same key replaces an earlier one.
Defaults are the ones in `LoadSettings`, never the registry.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `game_seed` | 1 | Seed of the game-logic random generator |
| `crt_seed` | 1 | Seed of the C runtime `rand` |
| `view_seed` | 1 | Seed of the presentation random generator (screen shake, particles, menu effects) |
| `fpu_control_word` | `0x9001F` | Expected `_control87` value, ignoring the infinity-control bit; the run exits 2 if it differs |
| `ticks` | required | Game ticks to play (30 per second of game time) |
| `map` | required | Map name, the rest of the line (names have spaces) |
| `difficulty` | 1 | AI difficulty 0 to 2, one value for all computer players |
| `commander_death` | 1 | 1: the game ends when a commander dies |
| `mapping` | 1 | 1: the whole map starts mapped |
| `line_of_sight` | 1 | 1: line of sight is on |
| `los_type` | 1 | Line of sight type, 0 or 1 |
| `start_positions` | `fixed` | `fixed`: player N starts at position N; `random`: shuffled |
| `local_player` | the first human player, else 0 | Slot whose view the game shows; must be a slot some `player<N>.*` key names |
| `player<N>.controller` | `ai` | `ai` or `human` (a human does nothing) |
| `player<N>.side` | N mod 2 (0 is Arm, 1 is Core) | Side name from `sidedata.tdf`, any case |
| `player<N>.team` | 5 | Ally group 0 to 4; 5 is no team |
| `player<N>.color` | N | Colour index 0 to 9 |
| `player<N>.metal` | 1000 | Starting metal |
| `player<N>.energy` | 1000 | Starting energy |

`player<N>.*` keys take N from 0 to 9. A slot exists when any key names it,
slots no key names are open, and at least 2 slots must exist. The game's player
count is the highest named slot plus one.
